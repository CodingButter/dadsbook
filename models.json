Although during takeoff over filled fuel tanks spilled into Harolds eyes blinding him and causing a crash. A second attempt at building the Explorer failed. So a third was made but now incorporating changes requested by Lindbergh including the name change to  \"Sirius\".

Despite the percieved drawbacks the British Air Ministry ordered 125 of the Bristiol M1c.

It used two turbo-charged engines whose exhaust was ejected at the rear of the engine nacelle, providing some additional thrust. The pilot was to sit in a pressurized cabin, and the plane's armament was very heavy for a fighter (six 37mm cannon in one prototype, and a 75mm cannon in another prototype). When viewed from above the aircraft had an unusual profile, in that the engine nacelles and fuselage were shaped to provide true aerofoil sections throughout. The first flight was made in January 1944, with testing undertaken later that year. Performance proved to be far from satisfactory, and modifications were made to improve certain stability problems. Before official trials could resume, however, the prototype was extensively damaged by fire and the program was abandoned.<br>\n<br>\n <br>\nThis is my first model specificaly made for Real Flight 6. No tangable data could be found for the real life flight characteristics. Therefore the physics for this model are based soley on an educated guess on my part. I find this one <br>\nfun to fly to to the reletivly high landing speed. This model requires power on landing! Once landed push up on the <br>\nelevator for brakes.<br>\n <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nEnjoy",

Virtually unknown outside Italy, the C.202 Folgore was the best fighter airplane fielded in significant numbers by the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force or RA) during World War II. This airplane demonstrated that Italy could design and build fighter aircraft to world-class standards. Aeronautica Macchi S. p. A. designed and built the Folgore (Lightning), which was based on an earlier Macchi design powered by a radial engine, the C.200 Saeta (Thunderbolt). To create the Folgore, Macchi's chief of design, Mario Castoldi, adapted the Saeta airframe to the German Daimler-Benz DB 601 liquid-cooled engine. Italy was a significant air-faring nation during the mid-1930s but its aviation industry began to lag late in the decade, particularly in engine development. No indigenous, in-line powerplant of sufficient power was available when the war started so early in 1940 Macchi had to import the German engine as a private venture. The results were impressive. Flat out, the Folgore was almost 97 kph (60 mph) faster than the Saeta's speed of 502 kph (312 mph).<br>\n<br>\nBuilt by request for U-bird<br>\n<br>\n <br>\nThis model features:<br>\nFully textured and animated cockpit<br>\nCanopy................................Channel 8(3pos)<br>\nMachine Guns......................Channel 8(3pos)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nEnjoy",

Despite the higher speed and better maneuverability It was rejected for it's high landing speeds that prevented it from landing in the small French airfields and the belief at the time that monoplanes were inherently unstable. Despite the perceived drawbacks the British Air Ministry ordered 125 of the Bristol M1c. Changes from the M1A and M1B were the LeRone 9 cylinder rotary engine and a centrally mounted Vickers .303 machine gun.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFeatures:<br>\nFixed scope camera------------------------------------F4<br>\nFixed wing port cameras-------------------------------F6 and F7<br>\nVickers machine gun------------------------------------Dual rates swithch<br>\nDetachable cowl to view the 9 cylinder LeRone----3 pos switch down position<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nEnjoy",

This model was made with the cooperation of Outrage and includes all of the changes between this model and it's predecessor. If you are familiar with the Velocity 90 N you will notice most of the changes aft of the main shaft. New CNC aluminium forward and rear tail rotor gear boxes. The main gear has been upgraded and the horizontal fin is omitted.
