Although not a winner the blue streak was a top qualifier in 1989 clocked at 242 mph. The only design info I can find on this one is that it has a high aspect ratio wing for turning stability. Also there's a pic of # 87 Madness (formerly #96)without it's cowling, and a four cylinder engine is clearly visible. Maybe someone could tell it's make just by looking. Also anyone who might be able to make a guess as to the airfoil would be a big help. Anyways its a racer just like the \"little tony\" found in G3 expansion pack 3. There are some differences though especially at the tail section. This is a very small full size aircraft and I'm not sure what size I should make the RF model.

Pre-flight the thing, climb in, and set out for a low and slow(er) late afternoon cruise...One day.<br>\n<br>\nLooking very paint-friendly.  My input is this, try to keep everything in scale to it's relative part, right fuse to left fuse, etc., which you have done.  Occupy vast sections of the texture map with the surfaces that will most likely get graphics and/or detailed paint like nose art.  Take up little bits of real estate with things like insides of control surfaces, small bits that will be one color.  Arrange the map so that text can go on in-line with either 90 or 180 degrees when possible.  All of this stuff looks like you have it in there.  <br>\n<br>\nLast thought, arrange the texture map in the most efficient manner possible, making the detailed areas large, but arranged well to maximaize space.  Things like a detailed dash panel and/or cockpit interior will require an increased proportion of the texture map, but will look fantastic in-sim, particularly in G5 just in case someone wants to fly first person.  <br>\n<br>\nSo, I would arrange things to make space for that, see attached as an example, I've got some room on my rearranged version of your texture map to make the dash panel and some other things larger, to allow for greater detail at the same resolution.  All of your parts are on this example, the exact same size as on your map.  I also understand you can map some areas at higher resolution on the same map, but simply making those areas larger works well, too.<br>\n<br>\nAll of these things are just a painter's selfish wants, ultimately, it is all up to you and we will willingly work with what is in there.   <img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" class=\"smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile    :)\" data-shortname=\":)\"> <br>\n<br>\nMy opinion is you are very much on the right track, it looks great.<br>\n<br>\nGriff<br>\ntwoeleven","dateTime":1293461357,"messageName":"twoeleven"},{"attachments":[],"body":"The final arrangement is a bit like a game of tetris.

What you are seeing is more of the top and bottom of the fuse than we are used to seeing.  It isnt just a pixel or two stretching across the top and bottom areas.  As it is an unwrap, this will make it appear taller than it is, as the top and bottom can be painted with less distortion, and then rewrapped around the 3D mesh by RF.

Originally an open-cockpit landplane, the Lindberghs' Sirius was modified with a sliding canopy and Edo floats for their two overwater journeys in 1931 and 1933.<br>\n<br>\nThe Lindberghs set a coast-to-coast speed record in the Sirius on April 20, 1930, but its most significant flights were in 1931 and 1933. In 1931 the Lindberghs flew to the Orient, proving the viability of traveling from the West to the Far East via the Great Circle route to the North. In 1933 they flew survey flights across the North and South Atlantic to gather information for planning commercial air routes.

The model is a blast to fly, so maybe we can make a <br>\nsim model that's fun too.<br>\n<br>\nCheers,<br>\nMike<br>\n<br>\nDagger flying video:  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fCO8tf91qc\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fCO8tf91qc</a><br>\n<br>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t<div class=\"lbContainer lbContainer--inline \" title=\"\" data-xf-init=\"lightbox\" data-lb-single-image=\"1\" data-lb-container-zoom=\"1\" data-lb-trigger=\".js-lbImage-_xfUid-1-1625055941\" data-lb-id=\"_xfUid-1-1625055941\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"lbContainer-zoomer js-lbImage-_xfUid-1-1625055941\" data-src=\"http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/i-DcVvs7N/0/L/dagger%203-L.jpg\" aria-label=\"Zoom\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<img src=\"http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/i-DcVvs7N/0/L/dagger%203-L.jpg\" data-url=\"http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/i-DcVvs7N/0/L/dagger%203-L.jpg\" class=\"bbImage\" data-zoom-target=\"1\" style=\"\">\n\t</div>\n\n <br>\n<br>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t<div class=\"lbContainer lbContainer--inline \" title=\"\" data-xf-init=\"lightbox\" data-lb-single-image=\"1\" data-lb-container-zoom=\"1\" data-lb-trigger=\".js-lbImage-_xfUid-2-1625055941\" data-lb-id=\"_xfUid-2-1625055941\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"lbContainer-zoomer js-lbImage-_xfUid-2-1625055941\" data-src=\"http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/i-TVdZtjz/0/XL/dagger%20plan%20sheet%201-XL.jpg\" aria-label=\"Zoom\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<img src=\"http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/i-TVdZtjz/0/XL/dagger%20plan%20sheet%201-XL.jpg\" data-url=\"http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/i-TVdZtjz/0/XL/dagger%20plan%20sheet%201-XL.jpg\" class=\"bbImage\" data-zoom-target=\"1\" style=\"\">\n\t</div>\n\n <br>\n<br>\nBigger Plan sheet 1:  <a href=\"http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/10207545_Hn6jm#1263490766_TVdZtjz-O-LB\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/10207545_Hn6jm#1263490766_TVdZtjz-O-LB</a><br>\n<br>\nBigger Plan sheet 2:<a href=\"http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/10207545_Hn6jm#1263491462_8Nmk7pv-O-LB\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/10207545_Hn6jm#1263491462_8Nmk7pv-O-LB</a><br>\n<br>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t<div class=\"lbContainer lbContainer--inline \" title=\"\" data-xf-init=\"lightbox\" data-lb-single-image=\"1\" data-lb-container-zoom=\"1\" data-lb-trigger=\".js-lbImage-_xfUid-3-1625055941\" data-lb-id=\"_xfUid-3-1625055941\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"lbContainer-zoomer js-lbImage-_xfUid-3-1625055941\" data-src=\"http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/i-8Nmk7pv/0/XL/dagger%20plan%20sheet%202-XL.jpg\" aria-label=\"Zoom\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<img src=\"http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/i-8Nmk7pv/0/XL/dagger%20plan%20sheet%202-XL.jpg\" data-url=\"http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/i-8Nmk7pv/0/XL/dagger%20plan%20sheet%202-XL.jpg\" class=\"bbImage\" data-zoom-target=\"1\" style=\"\">\n\t</div>\n\n <br>\n<br>\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t<div class=\"lbContainer lbContainer--inline \" title=\"\" data-xf-init=\"lightbox\" data-lb-single-image=\"1\" data-lb-container-zoom=\"1\" data-lb-trigger=\".js-lbImage-_xfUid-4-1625055941\" data-lb-id=\"_xfUid-4-1625055941\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"lbContainer-zoomer js-lbImage-_xfUid-4-1625055941\" data-src=\"http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/i-mR5jkHq/0/XL/dagger%204-XL.jpg\" aria-label=\"Zoom\"></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<img src=\"http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/i-mR5jkHq/0/XL/dagger%204-XL.jpg\" data-url=\"http://andy29847.smugmug.com/Other/RD-photos/i-mR5jkHq/0/XL/dagger%204-XL.jpg\" class=\"bbImage\" data-zoom-target=\"1\" style=\"\">\n\t</div>\n\n <br>\n<br>\nMike also promises some 3-view style pics that might make things easier for the color scheme.","dateTime":1303673772,"messageName":"andy29847"},{"attachments":[],"body":"<b>Modelers</b><br>\n<br>\nBoof69 is modeling the plane, abaser has the CS.

I watched postings on this site till late last night and gave up keeping up!  The model looks great and just like the RC version.<br>\n<br>\nIf there is anything I can do to assist just ask, and I'll get the 3-view photos to you ASAP.  <br>\n<br>\nHere is some info about the final build version if it helps...<br>\n<br>\nI moved the front fuselage transition from square to the round spinner plate about 3 inches back behind the firewall on the top corners (less on the bottom) than indicated on the plans.  I also increased the corner radius.  So the front fuselage looks more streamlined than shown in the plans and blends smoothly with the spinner.  See attached photos.<br>\n<br>\nAlso note that this is one of the only flying wings in the world that flys with no reflex on the elevons.  They are set perfectly in line with the wing cord.  Low rates are +/-1/4 inch, high is +/- 3/8.<br>\n<br>\nJust FYI.  Top speed was clocked at 118 mph with a sport prop(!).  Landing speed is about 10 mph.  Handles very smoothly and is not overly pitch sensitive like some flying wings.  However, if you set high rates and jerk the stick back it will simply rotate 90 degrees instantly.  After I added the wing fences it will no longer stall, just mushes down with about a 10+ deg angle of attack.<br>\n<br>\nQuite fun.

As Boof69 noticed on the wing tips, the group of planes did display two different types of tips.  The older tip is rounder from front to back.  The other tip is a newer and preferred one.  It is to help the air stay more in control ( smaller vortex ) behind the tips of the wing. I did not read this on any tractor sight but the same tips are used on the Scouts from American champion company.  I also talked to a pilot who flew a Citabria and an air tractor while on leave last year.  He told me the tips smaller vortex keeps the spray of chemicals in a straight line for a even spray across the spray bar.  <br>\n<br>\nI have even see another tip ( Pic 3 )that is rounder along the top edge and all most flat on the bottom and flat on it's side.  I believe it is the oldest tip.  It's nav light are farther forward.  I took these picture in Alabama while talking to the pilots and owners.  The guy had some of the biplanes Bob cats as well.

The higher the displacement value percentage the more buoyant a given object will be. A value of 500 will put the floats right up on top of the water. The real problem was the the big set of dualies setting in the water under the floats. I raised the displacement value and it helped quite a bit. The other important value was flooded displacement percentage. By default objects other than floats are given a value of 80. Which means it will take on water. 4 water logged tires hanging under the floats wasn't helping. With those changes the water behavior is normal. Now that the ground and water handling are  under control I can focus on flight. Went back into max and modeled more detail.

I think this is do to the weight of the model and the why the engine is over the steering wheels.

There are lots of really great things on this. I do see a couple things my perfectionist eye is catching... there is one spot at the wing tip where it meets the fuselage that a color bleeds through onto the fuselage... it is tiny but there. Seems to only be there on the right side. Servos \"free-float\" in the wing stringers so it looks like they are just black boxes and do not have a brand on the CS... anything will work... even \"boof69\" brand. PLane had a very stong tendency to tip stall on heavy elevator which indicates tail-heavy... Looked at tail and seemed a little heavy at 3oz. per side so I reduced to 2. V-stab seemed heavy as well... reduced to 2.25. Flew better with no tendency to tip stall. Looked at the motor setup.. thought it strange that the helical and prop wash were severely reduced. Put back to 100%. Also thought it was strange that the \"custom engine\" had its torque reduced to 50%. Put back and that was a mistake. Something is up there or I missed something discussed here. Weights were adjusted and airfoils seemed reasonable. It still did not \"moosh\" in the air that I would expect a model of this design to do. I set all stall severity to %65 and that seems right. I would have thought that more would be needed but 65% seems right. <br>\n<br>\nJust my thoughts. Really a wonderful model.

I originally had this model flying a bit more docile, but the few that test flew it before release commented on it being underpowered and that it was a pattern flyer in RL so I boosted the power and reset the throws. <br>\nAs for the tip stall condition its more of a product of a roll coupling issue. If elevator throw is increased its very pronounced.<br>\nTail heavy is not the problem. If anything its always been nose heavy which is why I introduced some incedence in the H-stab and a bit of trim on the elevator. I made the engine mods to get the plane to fly the way the few people that test flew it wanted it to. <br>\nI think the color bleed that your seeing is intentional shading I applied. Its all over the model actually its just abit darker there. Its known as ambient occlusion or (AO) <br>\nI took off the servo tabs to steal polys for other more visible areas.

I am using Joe's Garage AP for this comparison so I could position the camera without perspective. Relative scale from environment to model is not proportionate to real world scale. <br>\n So since the discussion involves the Bristol's scale I will use it to demonstrate. The first picture shows the visual scale of the Bristol: 10.09ft. If I set it on almost any runway in the sim this problem can be seen. Lane widths in the U.S vary from 9ft to 12 ft 12ft being the standard for highways and narrower widths for surface streets. In the second picture I have positioned the bristol on the left lane. If scale in RF were correct the lane should be no more than 2ft wider than the bristol. More likely though the road should be the same width or narrower. The last picture shows that the road's total width at Joe's is 41.20ft. Those are some luxurious lanes at 20ft a piece. To have a model in real flight that actually looks like a 10ft wing span you would need to make it 20ft.<br>\n  So I stand by my contention that planes seem small in RF.

It used two turbo-charged engines whose exhaust was ejected at the rear of the engine nacelle, providing some additional thrust. The pilot was to sit in a pressurized cabin, and the plane's armament was very heavy for a fighter (six 37mm cannon in one prototype, and a 75mm cannon in another prototype). When viewed from above the aircraft had an unusual profile, in that the engine nacelles and fuselage were shaped to provide true aerofoil sections throughout. The first flight was made in January 1944, with testing undertaken later that year. Performance proved to be far from satisfactory, and modifications were made to improve certain stability problems. Before official trials could resume, however, the prototype was extensively damaged by fire and the program was abandoned.<br>\n<br>\n <br>\nThis is my first model specificaly made for Real Flight 6. No tangable data could be found for the real life flight characteristics. Therefore the physics for this model are based soley on an educated guess on my part. I find this one <br>\nfun to fly to to the reletivly high landing speed. This model requires power on landing!

My rule of thumbs has been to model everything with gear down. Gear doors are the exception. The Polikarpov I-16 I did gave me nothing but a nightmare of trouble trying to get the gear to work right. The angles I had to enter for the correct rotation made no sense. At one point I gave up and  released it only to be hammered with bad critiques. I redacted the model and pressed forward to fix the issues. <br>\n<br>\nMy suspicion is that you have a weird issue with your wheels' pivot point. Generally the pivot point works fine because it usually only uses the x axis for rolling but the Mosquito I know uses a Springy scale landing gear type. This simulates the oleo strus by simply having the tire bob up and down  rather than the actual gear. This is then done on the y-axis. You get a great image of how this works if you simply align the pivots to the correct x axis and then export and incluse the springy scale retracts. It looks funky. <br>\n<br>\nto my point...If you have modeled the gear and then rotated it correctly into position the wheels' pivot will also carry along that path. If you have rotated the gear an odd angle here or there it will reflect in the way the wheel will rotate or bounce. The wheel location should be set to the weighed-down point in 3DSMax when using this type of gear. Then adjust your springiness factor to accommodate excessive bouncing and sag in the strut.

I do think that there are many things that you could have done that have been written up on in many of the tutorials on physics here.<br>\n<br>\nI personally think that for the given weight and wing loading it is a particularly \"floaty\" plane. Leading me to believe you have far too much lift from the way you linked the fuselage and nacelles. Then adding a wing there just makes more lift even though you reduce fuselage aerodynamics. You put two large masses at teh tail and nose... pick one. Adding weight for weight sake is just crazy. Why would you want it heavier than it has to be.

The fuselage parts were added. Its a trade off as severe crashes are odd but it flies more true. <br>\n<br>\nA wing loading of 27.215 oz/sq.ft. is not going to give the glide factor you are getting. Basically the model is too heavy for the wing area you are calculated to have. <br>\n<br>\nMy suggestion would be to separate the wings/nacelle areas from the fuselage. Then  use your wings setup as-is to simulate the streamlined area. You could use helper objects for the nacelles or just separate them and use the wings and add the nacelles but I think you would run into additional lift then as well. Just add the engines to the wings so they properly break off when the wing breaks. The wing should be the parent of the engines... not part of the root of the aircraft.

I would like for it to be bigger and faster, but that is how I am about most planes.  The discussion about physics is interesting.   The 2 lines of thought seem to be \"make it just like a model\" and \"make it fly like a model (or some times like the real plane)\".  My limited experience has found that radical adjustments in weight, weight distribution, and power are needed as the planes get more complex and/or bigger.  Since I am a end product kind of guy, and all my flying is on the computer, adjusting physics via unusual values works for me.

In 1930 they build their own plant in Deurne (Antwerp Belgium) and the production started in 1933. The Belgian Air Force would replace their Tiger Moths and ordered 66 SV-4B planes. Only 65 were delivered.<br>\nIn France and Algeria approx 850 Stampe SV 4A and SV 4C were built mostly powered by a 140 h.p.

The Corsair. I'm aware that there is no shortage of Corsairs between add ons and the swaps, but I'm building one because it's my favorite. There are little differences though. This is the first production version of the corsair  The F4U 1 has a \"Birdcage\" style canopy and directly behind it the fuselage has cutouts to provide rearward visibility. The cowl is different, it has no scoops built into it like later models. The exhaust is positioned below the wing's level and is outfitted with flame suppressors. Other small details are different from the other available models as well, but they are minor. This will be the most fun I've had modeling I suspect because I like the airplane so much. I have put no time limit on it or a poly limit. I will not be working on other projects during the build either. <br>\n<br>\n I'm hoping there are members here that have flown a scale model of a Corsair that would like to help with the physics when the time comes.

Maybe Andy can expand on what he has done here in this thread for all I care. I watch allot of the high speed modeling of cars to find new techniques that other modelers are using. One thing that you may find interesting is reading up on \"edge flow\". Modeling with edgeflow in mind will turn out very smooth models. This is why just sticking a wing into a roundish fuse looks sub par. Directing the fuse edgeflow into the wing makes a clean smooth transition. Another good thing to learn is re topologizing your geometry. I will make a part in a very fast way to get its general shape then I  will draw in new edges that better follow the nature of the part. This will often result in a lower poly count as well. <br>\nOne last point- silhouette is very important for low poly models. If you think of the most common view of these airplane (left side,right side, top, and bottom) and concentrate polys in the curved areas the model will come out much nicer in the end. I you have long straight areas such as wing root to wing tip there is no need to have many if any perpendicular edges in areas like these. Also it is almost impossible for the viewer to notice the exact airfoil shape so to have allot of longitudinal lines delineating the airfoil is highly unnecessary. Probably way more than you wanted me to say sorry. You are doing terrific so keep it up.","dateTime":1331053583,"messageName":"Boof69"},{"attachments":[{"path":"./images/threads/The New Ryan G5_EA/article-3-attachment-0.jpg","uri":"https://www.knifeedge.com/forums/index.php?attachments/zzz-jpg.44511/"},{"path":"./images/threads/The New Ryan G5_EA/article-3-attachment-1.jpg","uri":"https://www.knifeedge.com/forums/index.php?attachments/zzz1-jpg.44512/"},{"path":"./images/threads/The New Ryan G5_EA/article-3-attachment-2.jpg","uri":"https://www.knifeedge.com/forums/index.php?attachments/zzz2-jpg.44513/"},{"path":"./images/threads/The New Ryan G5_EA/article-3-attachment-3.jpg","uri":"https://www.knifeedge.com/forums/index.php?attachments/zzz3-jpg.44514/"}],"body":"As for the tools, Under file&gt;user preferences&gt;add ons, scroll down through them and see what you may find interesting, or beneficial and turn them on.

All I have left to model is the fuel filler and fuel level indicator. The poly count sits at 19,200. I will start mapping first part of next week.

Virtually unknown outside Italy, the C.202 Folgore was the best fighter airplane fielded in significant numbers by the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force or RA) during World War II. This airplane demonstrated that Italy could design and build fighter aircraft to world-class standards. Aeronautica Macchi S. p. A. designed and built the Folgore (Lightning), which was based on an earlier Macchi design powered by a radial engine, the C.200 Saeta (Thunderbolt). To create the Folgore, Macchi's chief of design, Mario Castoldi, adapted the Saeta airframe to the German Daimler-Benz DB 601 liquid-cooled engine. Italy was a significant air-faring nation during the mid-1930s but its aviation industry began to lag late in the decade, particularly in engine development. No indigenous, in-line powerplant of sufficient power was available when the war started so early in 1940 Macchi had to import the German engine as a private venture. The results were impressive. Flat out, the Folgore was almost 97 kph (60 mph) faster than the Saeta's speed of 502 kph (312 mph).<br>\n<br>\nBuilt by request for U-bird<br>\n<br>\n <br>\nThis model features:<br>\nFully textured and animated cockpit<br>\nCanopy................................Channel 8(3pos)<br>\nMachine Guns......................Channel 8(3pos)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nEnjoy","credits":{"colorSchemeBy":"Boof69","modeledBy":"Boof69","physicsBy":"Boof69"},"renders":[{"local":"/images/renders/Macchi C 202 Folgore_EA/render-0.jpg","uri":"https://www.knifeedge.com/forums/index.php?attachments/screenshot1338597688_s52-jpg.94146/"},{"local":"/images/renders/Macchi C 202 Folgore_EA/render-1.jpg","uri":"https://www.knifeedge.com/forums/index.php?attachments/screenshot1338597739_zsz-jpg.94147/"},{"local":"/images/renders/Macchi C 202 Folgore_EA/render-2.jpg","uri":"https://www.knifeedge.com/forums/index.php?attachments/5_7jr-jpg.94148/"},{"local":"/images/renders/Macchi C 202 Folgore_EA/render-3.jpg","uri":"https://www.knifeedge.com/forums/index.php?attachments/4_zmx-jpg.94149/"}],"threadData":[{"attachments":[{"path":"./images/threads/Macchi C 202 Folgore_EA/article-0-attachment-0.jpg","uri":"https://www.knifeedge.com/forums/index.php?attachments/1-jpg.44934/"},{"path":"./images/threads/Macchi C 202 Folgore_EA/article-0-attachment-1.jpg","uri":"https://www.knifeedge.com/forums/index.php?attachments/mc_202_folgore_sized-jpg.44935/"}],"body":"This is the Italian built and flown WWII fighter the Macchi C.202.

I did a rework on the canopy. You'll notice that it is now round instead of having corners. The H-Stab fairing is added and the turbo charger intake/sand filter has been fit more closely to the fuse and I've added corrugation. The rear radiator has been redone with a more proper squared off appearance. The shudder is also added there.  The front radiator has been shaped more correctly with it's shudder added as well. The landing gear have been started. So the wells are roughed in and the doors are attached to the gear but not much more detail than that is in that area yet.

Albeit overpowered the balance is really nice. I do have one problem maybe someone can help me with. The flaps are split on the Macchi and I thought I would emulate that more closely by adding moveable pods and wings under the main wings. The problem is that they seem to behave like airbrakes over quarter throttle and drag the nose down. I'm using balsa flat stab for the airfoil.

The flaps, when closed, do have isues, at the trailing edge, where the long and short come together, 95. I do take, isues with the flight. At 11ft. , it is a large scale (Big Bird). It is probably14 lbs too light, has much to fast of a rool rate, has way to much rudder autharity, and the off power sink rate, not even close. It hovers like an ugly stick with a pipe. In level flight mine does climb, all trims centered, and calibrated. While a good flyer, not true to large scale. The gun fire looks so real, I had to duck, he he.

I was talking about limiting the loss of wing lift off the wing tips, the same way the do with all new air liners, and privet jets. The air flow is not stright across the wing at the tips of the wings, but rather it slips side ways off the wing tips. So, adding the turned up tips, at 90 degs, you stop that loss, and force the air off the traling edge of the wing, which helps when the plane gets slow.<br>\nThe makeing the elevator in one piece, as a RC model, means getting by with one servo on the elevator.","dateTime":1305073497,"messageName":"flexible"},{"attachments":[],"body":"I've got this one flying great.

I haven't  played with airfoils or frontal drag etc... but that will work out just fine i'm sure. The tricycle retracts each use a two door configuration one big one small.

I am using Joe's Garage AP for this comparison so I could position the camera without perspective. Relative scale from environment to model is not proportionate to real world scale. <br>\n So since the discussion involves the Bristol's scale I will use it to demonstrate. The first picture shows the visual scale of the Bristol: 10.09ft. If I set it on almost any runway in the sim this problem can be seen. Lane widths in the U.S vary from 9ft to 12 ft 12ft being the standard for highways and narrower widths for surface streets. In the second picture I have positioned the bristol on the left lane. If scale in RF were correct the lane should be no more than 2ft wider than the bristol. More likely though the road should be the same width or narrower. The last picture shows that the road's total width at Joe's is 41.20ft. Those are some luxurious lanes at 20ft a piece. To have a model in real flight that actually looks like a 10ft wing span you would need to make it 20ft.<br>\n  So I stand by my contention that planes seem small in RF.

HUGE difference in engine there. I would have gone with the DA100 sound as it is much closer.<br>\n-main wheel alignment in physics with graphics do not match vertically. <br>\n-wheel weight seems a bit low. two 2oz wheels to support a 20 pound plane? While not impossible I personally would want something more robust.<br>\n-Flaps. Physics do not match movement of actual flap. I used pods in my Tenzan and it worked out great for this effect. <br>\n<br>\nStuff I LOVE (aside from the as-usually prettiness of the subject):<br>\n-IT STALLS!!!! power-off and pull back slightly reveals a slight stall that is quite recoverable! <br>\n-Power to weight ratio is as it should be and not too overpowered to make it 3D but fly like a civilian aircraft.<br>\n-Balance is great. Use of ballast at the tail to get it right. 6oz is nothing on a plane this size and is a great use of rel-world building. Ground handling is interesting on grass and nose-ins are typical if you are not careful. With the short nose and wheel placement this is as it should be in relation to the CoG. <br>\n<br>\nOverall:<br>\nWhat a great model. Clearly your physics chops are getting better with each model.

This long nosed aircraft looks very sleek and streamlined but the tiny manually retracted landing gear give it a ungainly appearance.

My input is this, try to keep everything in scale to it's relative part, right fuse to left fuse, etc., which you have done.  Occupy vast sections of the texture map with the surfaces that will most likely get graphics and/or detailed paint like nose art.  Take up little bits of real estate with things like insides of control surfaces, small bits that will be one color.  Arrange the map so that text can go on in-line with either 90 or 180 degrees when possible.  All of this stuff looks like you have it in there.  <br>\n<br>\nLast thought, arrange the texture map in the most efficient manner possible, making the detailed areas large, but arranged well to maximaize space.  Things like a detailed dash panel and/or cockpit interior will require an increased proportion of the texture map, but will look fantastic in-sim, particularly in G5 just in case someone wants to fly first person.  <br>\n<br>\nSo, I would arrange things to make space for that, see attached as an example, I've got some room on my rearranged version of your texture map to make the dash panel and some other things larger, to allow for greater detail at the same resolution.  All of your parts are on this example, the exact same size as on your map.  I also understand you can map some areas at higher resolution on the same map, but simply making those areas larger works well, too.<br>\n<br>\nAll of these things are just a painter's selfish wants, ultimately, it is all up to you and we will willingly work with what is in there.   <img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" class=\"smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1\" alt=\":)\" title=\"Smile    :)\" data-shortname=\":)\"> <br>\n<br>\nMy opinion is you are very much on the right track, it looks great.<br>\n<br>\nGriff<br>\ntwoeleven","dateTime":1293461357,"messageName":"twoeleven"},{"attachments":[],"body":"The final arrangement is a bit like a game of tetris.

Originally an open-cockpit landplane, the Lindberghs' Sirius was modified with a sliding canopy and Edo floats for their two overwater journeys in 1931 and 1933.<br>\n<br>\nThe Lindberghs set a coast-to-coast speed record in the Sirius on April 20, 1930, but its most significant flights were in 1931 and 1933. In 1931 the Lindberghs flew to the Orient, proving the viability of traveling from the West to the Far East via the Great Circle route to the North. In 1933 they flew survey flights across the North and South Atlantic to gather information for planning commercial air routes.

I'm beginning to wonder if making a single panel wing but having the wing spread over 4 sections in the Schematic is the same. That is I used ~CS_RMW and ~CS_LMW for my wing panel but the real plane has wing panel sections before that in the schematic, don't know just something to try maybe. It's definitely a cool plane and it would be nice to get it going in RF-X. But RF-X is dead so there's only a few of us that actually fly it these days and that's too bad because the Wright Island area is really good and showed how much better RF-X really is.

But going by the RF-X System Requirements it was an Optimal System. But almost everyone thought the system requirements was a joke.<br>\n<br>\nI had an I7 4770S at 3.1 GHZ with 32 GB of RAM and a GTX760 when I got RF-X and I didn't like the frame rates I was getting at 1920x1200 to me they were painful frame rates for an aircraft simulator, others could tolerate it.<br>\n<br>\nYour graphics card would give you a \"clear\" advantage over my system when I first got RF-X because of the GTX1060 but your CPU on the other hand is way slower than what I had at the time yours 2.2 Ghz mine 3.1 Ghz and it does take some CPU horsepower to push the frame rates in RF-X it just takes a lot more GPU than CPU. But the CPU has to push the simulator at a decent frame rate before a GPU matters at all. I don't know how much you know about how the CPU and GPU affect frame rates but there's quite a bit to it. But first it's important that the CPU can process the frames fast enough before the GPU can do anything with them. So there's an important balance. But RF-X is way harder on the GPU than the CPU.<br>\n<br>\nHere's two charts I created at the time that might help you. All the information you want to know is in the chart just read it and you should get a decent picture of what my system did at the time. Now the updates they did helped so if you get it be sure to update it fully before trying it out because that really helps. And try out the Wright Island field right away it's by far the best field they did. But some of the others let you fly in the mountains and are definitely cool.<br>\n<br>\nBut honestly if your CPU can push a decent frame rate (don't know) I think for 40 bucks I'd get it just to see what RF-X is all about. But be sure to patch it to the latest release before you try it out because that makes A LOT of difference in frame rates.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.knifeedge.com/forums/index.php?attachments/2016-11-10-1230pm-rf-x-monte-vista-l-39-albatross-1920x1200-i7-4770s-32g-gtx760-jpg.118059/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"js-lbImage\"><img src=\"http://www.knifeedge.com/forums/data/attachments/106/106264-11d1d6415e6bf001fb7259a709434d0c.jpg\" class=\"bbImage \" style=\"\" alt=\"2016-11-10 1230PM RF-X Monte Vista L-39 Albatross 1920x1200 I7 4770S 32G GTX760.jpg\" title=\"2016-11-10 1230PM RF-X Monte Vista L-39 Albatross 1920x1200 I7 4770S 32G GTX760.jpg\"></a><a href=\"https://www.knifeedge.com/forums/index.php?attachments/2016-11-10-1519pm-rf-x-castle-at-6-texas-1920x1200-i7-4770s-32g-gtx760-jpg.118060/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"js-lbImage\"><img src=\"http://www.knifeedge.com/forums/data/attachments/106/106265-264a47d4fc5a69f3ecab356a18e8fe09.jpg\" class=\"bbImage \" style=\"\" alt=\"2016-11-10 1519PM RF-X Castle AT 6 Texas 1920x1200 I7 4770S 32G GTX760.jpg\" title=\"2016-11-10 1519PM RF-X Castle AT 6 Texas 1920x1200 I7 4770S 32G GTX760.jpg\"></a>","dateTime":1590014919,"messageName":"technoid"},{"attachments":[],"body":"Thanks for the info Tech, I think I will take the gamble since I already have the interlink controller and found RF-X for 50 bucks including shipping.","dateTime":1590017595,"messageName":"Rc51dude"},{"attachments":[],"body":"<blockquote class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote\">\n\t\n\t\t<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"/forums/index.php?goto/post&amp;id=327984\" class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\" data-xf-click=\"attribution\" data-content-selector=\"#post-327984\">Rc51dude said:</a>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent \">\n\t\t\tThanks for the info Tech, I think I will take the gamble since I already have the interlink controller and found RF-X for 50 bucks including shipping.\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink\"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>\n\t</div>\n</blockquote>Yeah I'd do the same thing and hopefully your experience will be decent.","dateTime":1590018064,"messageName":"technoid"},{"attachments":[],"body":"My heart won't be broken if RF-X runs slow, I still have RF9<img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" class=\"smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite2\" alt=\";)\" title=\"Wink    ;)\" data-shortname=\";)\"> and RF8 and RF3.5 lol","dateTime":1590020602,"messageName":"Rc51dude"},{"attachments":[],"body":"Do you have Steam ?<br>\nIf you have Steam then download the ACRO FS Simulator (I think it is still a free \"Early Access\" program) ACRO FS is made by Jim Bourke (owner of Realflight) and ACRO FS is run with the same game engine as RF-X, which is Unigine2 and uses DirectX 11.

The spring is a dynamic object and it has many controls to set spring diameter, wire diameter, turns, and height . You can find it in the drop down box above the default objects.

At this time I didn´t know whats the story behind the Logo.<br>\nBoof told me, that this is a guy who passed away and this was his last wish, to be on that Helicopter. Also Boof told me, that this logo will stay on there at least a month!! He said If I have still Interest then I can write him again.<br>\n<br>\nSo this month is nearly over and I wroted a PM to Boof today, asking for this Logo free Version. Then he told me, that he will not remove that logo from it. I said that not the Logo is the problem, is more the position, cause many pilots love to place their Pilotsname exactly at this position. The only thing he said was \"You are a graphic designer, so build you own heli\"<br>\n<br>\nSo I thought \"Ok, he promised you to send you a logo free version, and now he don´t want anymore, i will do a joke\"<br>\n<br>\nSo I did a screenshot of the heli i did, and removed that logo in the picture, and told him I deleted it in the model<br>\n<br>\nOk again, this was a bad joke, but if some of you are able to do straight reasoning, then you will notice....<br>\n<br>\n1. Why should I ask for a logo free version if I can remove it by myself<br>\n2. Why should I wait one Month to contact him again for a logo free version if I could remove it<br>\n3. The removed Logo in the Screenshot is in a Black area, so no big deal to remove!<br>\n4. Even if I could do all this removing stuff, why in the hell should I tell it to the person that creates that Heli!!<br>\n5. Try to find a Plugin that is able to do it on Google! You won´t find one, cause it simply not exist, cause the interest of doing a hack plugin for a Special Interest application is very rare!!<br>\n<br>\nI have full respect for the logo on the goblin because of the history behind it. I will find another place for my pilotsname on it.

The \"logo\" is a 3d item and can only be removed by me or a thief of my geometry. <br>\nDid you remove it?<br>\n<br>\n<b>Groni</b><br>\nThere are some 3rd party plugins for 3DMax/Blender to convert them. Little tricky to do, but finaly editable. Export back and there you go.... But don´t worry, it´s just for me.<br>\n<br>\n<b>My response</b><br>\nI will make sure that everyone knows that you are doing this with others intellectual properties.<br>\n<br>\nI think you are misrepresenting what happened. I told you I reconsidered and why. You pressed and Then I suggested that you model it for yourself.<br>\nNothing about the way you wrote your PMs would let on to any Joking. I asked for you to clarify and you said you used plugins to accomplish it. That's not funny to me. <img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" class=\"smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite4\" alt=\":mad:\" title=\"Mad    :mad:\" data-shortname=\":mad:\">\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink\"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>\n\t</div>\n</blockquote>If you would be able to do somekind of reasonable thinking you would know that i simply did a joke.

I did experiment with my 500 and i have found that the best results come from recording the heli on the ground with no blades, strapped to a table and i slowly go through different RPM's.

I don't think that I have seen any model, including the ones created by KE, satisfy everyone. There are just too many limits in this sandbox to allow the precision I'd like to be capable of.

On Revision 2, we changed the physics completley and doing them from scratch, cause simply said there were not even close to a real helicopter. Mostly because of missing weights and too much gain and things like that. So nothing is left from your work in any of my helicopters.<br>\n<br>\nDon´t get abused...I´m just doing that kind of stuff that you also wanted from me. Remember as you said I can use youre physics, but a small credit would be nice. I have that PN still in my inbox!

I never did plan on flying the real one it was on loan to build the model. The physics were tested by a Compass models sponsored pilot and he never mentioned a problem with the tail. If you would like a faster tail there a few ways to accomplish that. This is one: Change the \"Rotation Rate (deg/sec)\" parameter in the editor. You will find it in Electronics/Electronic Flybar/Yaw. It is currently set to 720° per second. Increasing this value will give faster rotation.","dateTime":1385339200,"messageName":"Boof69"}]}]
