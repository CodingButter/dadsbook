It used two turbo-charged engines whose exhaust was ejected at the rear of the engine nacelle, providing some additional thrust. The pilot was to sit in a pressurized cabin, and the plane's armament was very heavy for a fighter (six 37mm cannon in one prototype, and a 75mm cannon in another prototype). When viewed from above the aircraft had an unusual profile, in that the engine nacelles and fuselage were shaped to provide true aerofoil sections throughout. The first flight was made in January 1944, with testing undertaken later that year. Performance proved to be far from satisfactory, and modifications were made to improve certain stability problems. Before official trials could resume, however, the prototype was extensively damaged by fire and the program was abandoned.<br>\n<br>\n <br>\nThis is my first model specificaly made for Real Flight 6. No tangable data could be found for the real life flight characteristics. Therefore the physics for this model are based soley on an educated guess on my part. I find this one <br>\nfun to fly to to the reletivly high landing speed. This model requires power on landing!

    "description": "This is the Macchi C.202 Folgore (Lightning). Virtually unknown outside Italy, the C.202 Folgore was the best fighter airplane fielded in significant numbers by the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force or RA) during World War II. This airplane demonstrated that Italy could design and build fighter aircraft to world-class standards. Aeronautica Macchi S. p. A. designed and built the Folgore (Lightning), which was based on an earlier Macchi design powered by a radial engine, the C.200 Saeta (Thunderbolt). To create the Folgore, Macchi's chief of design, Mario Castoldi, adapted the Saeta airframe to the German Daimler-Benz DB 601 liquid-cooled engine. Italy was a significant air-faring nation during the mid-1930s but its aviation industry began to lag late in the decade, particularly in engine development. No indigenous, in-line powerplant of sufficient power was available when the war started so early in 1940 Macchi had to import the German engine as a private venture. The results were impressive. Flat out, the Folgore was almost 97 kph (60 mph) faster than the Saeta's speed of 502 kph (312 mph).<br>\n<br>\nBuilt by request for U-bird<br>\n<br>\n <br>\nThis model features:<br>\nFully textured and animated cockpit<br>\nCanopy................................Channel 8(3pos)<br>\nMachine Guns......................Channel 8(3pos)<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nEnjoy",

The Warp 360 is a low-maintenance, aggressive, powerful and quiet 450 size electric helicopter!<br>\n The Compass Warp 360 utilizes a single-stage direct belt drive which allows for an extremely quiet and efficient drive-train. The rotor head is comprised of a nearly rigid design by Compass Model. This head design provides a level of precision and aggressive response more commonly associated with the larger 90 size electrics, to the 450 size market.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThanks to the designer of the Compass Models Warp 360 <b>Sebastian Zajonz</b><br>\nSpecial thanks to <b>Sebastia Serra</b> for his help in tuning the physics.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nEnjoy",
